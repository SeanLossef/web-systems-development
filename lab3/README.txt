(1)
Our markup is semantically because it uses proper <time> tags with the datetime attributes filled out to idetify and provide metadata about dates,
it uses <img> tags with the alt attribute defined to provide alternative text,
and our individual pages utilize the hCard microformat to provide additional metadata about individual info.

(2)
Our pages use <div> to organize groups of objects that are positioned together or for objects that share a common background.
All <div> elements have descriptive class or id tags and are also used for other styling reasons.

Patricia Acorda:
The reason that the hCard format is so important is because it tells machine readers and even humans looking at that raw data extra information about the document
and the content within those tags. It helps provide an easy way to parse the complex information that is personal contact information.
This is extremely helpful for people who require reading aids in mobile/website apps.

Colleen Corrigan:
The hCard is a super useful way to organize information for both humans and machines. Having a standardized format with one location
for the address, email, and any other contact information makes it easier for humans to find this information. For machines, the format with
classes allow machines to parse through the information and find what it's looking for. This is useful if the information was needed elsewhere,
the machine can separate and reformat if necessary. An example of this being used is search engines, as it allows them to provide more information
to people during a search.

Charles Villagran:
It is an efficient wasy to organize information. having a consistent format leads to a set way to read and recieve information. Makes it easier and nicer to the eye.
