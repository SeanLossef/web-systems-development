(1)
Our markup is semantically because it uses proper <time> tags with the datetime attributes filled out to idetify and provide metadata about dates,
it uses <img> tags with the alt attribute defined to provide alternative text,
and our individual pages utilize the hCard microformat to provide additional metadata about individual info.

(2)
Our pages use <div> to organize groups of objects that are positioned together or for objects that share a common background.
All <div> elements have descriptive class or id tags and are also used for other styling reasons.

Patricia Acorda:
The reason that the hCard format is so important is because it tells machine readers and even humans looking at that raw data extra information about the document
and the content within those tags. It helps provide an easy way to parse the complex information that is personal contact information. 
This is extremely helpful for people who require reading aids in mobile/website apps.
