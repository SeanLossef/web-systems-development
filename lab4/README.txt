Part 1a:

Part 1b:
Between parts a & b of part 1, part b is more of a hardcoded solution that 
explicitly loops through and calls each element by class name to list them out. The return
values of 1a & 1b should not be different, since they are written to do the same thing.
The only difference is that 1a is a much more concise and elegant solution.

Part 2:

Part 3:
An .addEventListener() method was added that waited until the page was loaded before
becoming active. Once active, a new body element was cloned and appended. In order to
implement the mouseover effects for each body element, we used a for loop that went
through each node.

Creativity
Colleen - I changed the font style for both the h1 and h2 headings using an embedded font
from Google fonts.
Patricia - added a basic color scheme using root variables & changed the non-header fonts 
using Google imbedded fonts. Also added a hover color change for links with a transition timer.
