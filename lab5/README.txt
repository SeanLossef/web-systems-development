Lab 5 + 6

Creativity:
-Patricia: I worked on the general HTML outline and layout of the webpage, as well as the color scheme, fonts, and sizing of different sections.

Challenge Question:
LocalStorage is useful for storing session tokens to keep a browser signed into a website. The token can be sent to the server and the server can verify that the token is valid to grant access to a resouce. An example of this type of token is a JWT (JSON Web Token), where the token contains public user information as well as a hash that can be used to check validity. This is needed because local storage is not secure. Anything stored there is completely public to any code running in the browser so it should NEVER be used to store sensitive information.
